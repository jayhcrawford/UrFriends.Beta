This React + Node.js app assists users in developing their relationships. It is inspired by Benjamin Franklin's method of keeping a diary, as well as the methods of other global figures who have made significant impacts by paying careful attention to their relationships.

Custom tiers with custom periodic reminders prompt the user to stay in contact with the members of their phonebook--and when the user indicates that they've recently spoken, the user is prompted to take down notes on the conversation.

Each phonebook entry has access to the history of notes at the user's fingertips. You speak to Uncle Bob every 6 months? Oh yeah, he got in the IT department at Boeing--I wonder how he's liking that? 

Scheduling conversations is also at the user's fingertips. 

I will integrate Google and Apple API's for phonebook and calendar access. This beta will be hosted soon.
